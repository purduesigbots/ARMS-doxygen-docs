\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a helper union that defines a 2d point or vector. It defines a set of operators that can be used to perform vector operations more consisely.

A union was chosen to represent the point so that a couple different names can be used to access the same elements. For example\+:~\newline
point.\+x, point.\+data\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}, and point\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}~\newline
all refer to the same variable. 

The documentation for this union was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
C\+:/\+Users/btdav/\+Documents/\+COURSES/\+SIGBOTS/\+SOFTWARE/\+ARMS/include/\+ARMS/\mbox{\hyperlink{point_8h}{point.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
